MRS RABBIT GET ALL OUR THINGS TOGETHER HE SAID AND PUT RUBBER BOOTS 
ON OUR LITTLE RABS WE HAVE TO MOVE QUICKLY TO THE PINEY WOODS ACROSS THE 
BROOK OLD SLY FOX HAS FOUND OUR HOME AND WILL DESTROY US 

    IN NO TIME AT ALL THE RABBIT FAMILY HAD MOVED AND THE LITTLE RABS WERE 
DELIGHTED WITH THEIR NEW HOME A WOODLAND OF TOWERING PINES IT WAS THE 
GROUND COVERED WITH PINE NEEDLES WHICH MADE A SOFT CARPETING THE WIND MADE 
MUSIC IN THE PINE TREES BIRDS SANG AND THE FRAGRANCE OF FLOWERS FILLED THE 
AIR THEY FOUND A HUGE HOLLOW TREE WHERE MR RABBIT BURROWED DEEP AND MADE 
THEM A COZY HOME SQUIRRELS HAD LEFT NUTS HIDDEN AROUND IN THE OLD TREE 
OWLS HOOTED THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT CRICKETS CHIRPED MERRILY 

    NEXT MORNING OLD SLY FOX KNOCKED ON THE DOOR WHERE HE HAD LEFT MR 
RABBIT MRS HEDGEHOG ANSWERED THE DOOR GOOD MORNING MRS HEDGEHOG IS

UNTIL TOMORROW 

    DO YOU LIKE NICE YOUNG GRASSHOPPERS ASKED SLY FOX SOFTLY 

    DO I NOTHING SO GOOD AS TENDER YOUNG GRASSHOPPERS ANSWERED MRS 
HEDGEHOG FAIRLY DRIBBLING AT THE MOUTH AT THE THOUGHT OF SUCH A DAINTY

SACK AND RAKE IN ALL OF THEM WE WANT MOTHER WILL BAKE THEM WITH APPLES AND

RESIST SO IN THE SACK SHE WENT SLY FOX WITH A GRIN GRABBED THE SACK THREW 
IT OVER HIS SHOULDER AND TROTTED TOWARD HOME AFTER GOING A LONG WAY MRS 
HEDGEHOG BECAME SUSPICIOUS AND CRIED HOW LONG BEFORE WE REACH THAT FIELD 
OF GRASSHOPPERS 

    WHY YOU SILLY GREEDY HEDGEHOG THERE IS NO FIELD OF GRASSHOPPERS FOR 
YOU I AM GOING TO EAT YOU FOR MY DINNER ITS YOU WITH APPLE DUMPLINGS THAT 
MY MOTHER WILL BAKE 

    EVERY HAIR ON MRS HEDGEHOGS HEAD STOOD ON END WITH FRIGHT OH HOW 
FOOLISH SHE HAD BEEN HER GREED HAD TRAPPED HER IF ONLY SHE HAD STAYED HOME 
AND STRAIGHTENED HER HOUSE AND COOKED HER OWN DINNER SHE WOULD NOT HAVE 
BEEN IN THIS SACK TO BE EATEN BY SLY FOX GREEDINESS NEVER PAYS SHE THOUGHT 
TO HERSELF 

    SLY FOX BECAME TIRED AND AS A SLIGHT RAIN HAD BEGUN TO FALL HE LOOKED 
FOR A DRY PLACE TO SIT DOWN THROWING THE SACK TO THE GROUND AND CHUCKLING 
AT THE THOUGHT OF SITTING ON MRS HEDGEHOG HE DROPPED HEAVILY UPON THE 
SACK 

    WOW WOW HE CRIED JUMPING QUICKLY UP FOR MRS HEDGEHOG SHOT HER 
SHARP QUILLS INTO HIM WITH ALL HER MIGHT 

    SLY FOX RAN TO AND FRO TRYING TO PULL OUT THE QUILLS BUT THEY HAD GONE 
TOO DEEP HOME HE RAN SCREAMING TO HIS MOTHER OLD MOTHER FOX THREW HIM 
OVER A LOG AND BEGAN PULLING OUT THE QUILLS AT THE SAME TIME CALLING TO A 
NEIGHBOR FOX TO BRING SOME HONEY TO PUT ON THE PLACES WHERE THE QUILLS HAD 
BEEN 

    MRS HEDGEHOG CRAWLED OUT OF THE BAG AND BEGAN WALKING SLOWLY TOWARD 
HOME SHE THOUGHT TO HERSELF THAT NEVER AGAIN WOULD SHE BE SO GREEDY AND 
ALLOW HERSELF TO BE FOOLED BY SLY FOX OR ANY ONE ELSE 

    MEANWHILE MR RABBIT AND FAMILY WERE LIVING HAPPILY IN PINEY WOODS THE 
LITTLE RABS PLAYED ON THE CRYSTAL CLEAR BROOK THAT RAN THROUGH THE WOODS 
WADING SAILING LITTLE LEAF BOATS AND TRYING TO CATCH THE SILVERY MINNOWS 
DARTING HERE AND THERE 

    LATE ONE EVENING PAPA AND MAMA RABBIT WERE SITTING BEFORE THE COZY FIRE 
TALKING PAPA RABBIT HAD ON HIS HOUSE ROBE AND BEDROOM SLIPPERS READING THE 
NEWSPAPER EVERY NOW AND THEN HE LOOKED OVER HIS SPECTACLES LOVINGLY AT 
DAINTY LITTLE MAMA RABBIT DRESSED IN A FLOWERED HOUSECOAT AND RED SLIPPERS 
AND KNITTING LITTLE SOCKS FOR THE LITTLE RABS 

    SNIFF SNIFF SNIFF CAME SUDDENLY TO THEIR EARS 

    SLY FOX WHISPERED PAPA RABBIT HIS FACE NOW FULL OF CONCERN AND 
ALARM 

    YES AGREED MAMA RABBIT HER VOICE TREMBLING WITH FRIGHT 

    GO COVER THE LITTLE RABS WITH STRAW AND TELL THEM TO BE VERY VERY 
QUIET INSTRUCTED PAPA RABBIT 

    MRS RABBIT QUICKLY COVERED THE LITTLE RABS AND CAUTIONED THEM TO BE AS 
QUIET AS MICE SINCE THEY WERE WELL BEHAVED AND OBEDIENT LITTLE RABS THEY 
DID JUST AS THEIR MOTHER TOLD THEM 

    I LEFT MY BIG STICK BESIDE THE OLD OAK TREE CRIED PAPA RABBIT UNDER 
HIS BREATH WHAT SHALL WE DO 

    SNIFF SNIFF SNIFF WENT SLY FOX AGAIN SCRATCHING UP THE EARTH BY 
THE OLD HOLLOW TREE AS HE BEGAN TO DIG FURIOUSLY THE POOR LITTLE RABBIT 
FAMILY SAT STILL AND FRIGHTENED THEIR HEARTS THUMPING THEIR PAWS SHAKING 
AND THEIR EYES BULGING WITH PANIC SUDDENLY IN THE DISTANCE THEY HEARD THE 
TOOT TOOTTOOT OF HORNS AND THE WOOF WOOF WOOF OF BARKING DOGS 

    PAPA RABBIT WHISPERED FOX HUNTERS AS HIS HEART GAVE A BOUND OF 
RELIEF 

    NEARER AND NEARER CAME THE BAYING OF THE HOUNDS AND THE MUSIC OF THE 
HORNS OLD SLY FOX WAS SO BUSILY DIGGING THAT HE FAILED TO HEAR AT FIRST 
BUT SUDDENLY HE STOPPED DIGGING AND THREW BACK HIS EARS TO LISTEN THEN HE 
QUICKLY JUMPED AWAY FROM THE LOG WHERE THE RABBIT FAMILY LIVED AND STARTED 
RUNNING 

    BUT THE HOUNDS WERE RIGHT AFTER HIM BAYING LOUDLY WITH ALL THEIR MIGHT 
THE HORSES FEET BEAT OUT AN EXCITED RHYTHM AS THE REDCOATED FOX HUNTERS 
URGED THEM ON IN THE CHASE UP HILL OVER THE MEADOWS THEY RAN 

    SLY FOX WAS NOW RUNNING FOR HIS LIFE BUT THE DOGS WERE GETTING CLOSER 
AND CLOSER HE JUMPED ACROSS THE BROOK AND SPIED A HOLE AMONG SOME BUSHES 
INTO THIS HE SLID AND AS THE DOGS WENT DOWN THE SIDE OF THE STREAM OF WATER 
BEFORE THEY JUMPED ACROSS THEY LOST HIS SCENT SLY FOX QUICKLY RAN OUT OF 
THE HOLE AND TOOK OFF IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION FROM THE WAY THE DOGS WERE 
GOING HE HAD BEEN SO FRIGHTENED AND SO NEAR DEATH THAT HE RESOLVED TO 
HIMSELF NEVER TO BOTHER THE RABBIT FAMILY AGAIN 

    MEANWHILE WHEN PAPA RABBIT HAD HEARD THE HOUNDS START THE CHASE HE 
TURNED TO MAMA RABBIT AND CRIED SAFE AT LAST CALL OUR LITTLE RABS FOR 
PRAYERS OF THANKSGIVING AND PRAISE TO OUR FATHER WHICH ART IN HEAVEN 

    AFTER PRAYERS MAMA RABBIT HUSTLED ABOUT MAKING MINT TEA FOR HER AND 
PAPA RABBIT AND HOT CHOCOLATE PILED HIGH WITH WHIPPED CREAM FOR THE LITTLE 
RABS AFTER THAT TIME THEY LIVED HAPPILY AMONG THE GREAT WHISPERING PINES 
NEVER BOTHERED BY OLD SLY FOX
                                                          BEULAH MURRELLE
